        <h2>Objective: </h2>
        While an auto purchasing is not a unique idea, many novel feartures were introduced in this app - all of those informed by in-depth, user reasearch.

        <h2>Research: </h2>

        To properly inform the features of this app, a range of user reserach methods were implemted such as storyboarding, scenario crafting, flow mapping and journey mapping.
