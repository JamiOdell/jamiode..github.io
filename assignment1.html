            <p>I am employed at BECU as a Senior UX designer. I help create products that are useful to our members. </p>
            <br>

            <h3>Skill sets</h3>

            <h2>Assignment 1</h2>

            <hr>

            <h2>UX Development Process</h2>

                <li>NOT myself, I already know who I am</li>
                <li>NOT friends or family, they know who I am</li>
                <li>Observation of Jami's environment: Fellow workers who have heard of Jami but do not know him personally are most likely the <b>target user</b>
                </li>
            </ul>


            <h2>Reserch question: What context will the name plate be used?</h2>

                <li>NOT in my home, I don't need to find myself</li>
                <li>Observation: Likely in my place of work, where it is common for co-workers to know the name of a co-worker but do not know where they sit in the building or what they look like</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Problem statement</h2>

                <li>We believe that a Name Plate will help fellow co-workers quickly and easily locate me inside of a large office building so they can provide me with important information or ask me a question.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Research</h2>
            <ul>
                <li> Conducted contextual interviews with fellow co-workers to discover what they are intending to do when seeking me out for person to person interactions.</li>
