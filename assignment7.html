        <h2>Concept</h2>

        <ul>

            <li>The design intention for my final project is to produce a product that is a combination of novelty and utility</li>
            <li> I have a fondness for retro robots and like to decorate my home and work office with robots as novelty items</li>
            <li>I called my project the Carry-it 2000 Robot</li>
            <li>I started my project by gathering inspiration and drafting concept sketches</li>
            <li>For utility, the robot of my creation will hold items I use daily such as post-it notes, business cards, sharpies etc.</li>
             <li>From the sketches I created a cardboard proof of concept. Spatically it appeared to fit together nicely</li>
            <li>In Rhino I made adjustable so as to move the carried object into a more desired or visible position for ease of interaction.
            </li>

        </ul>

        <h2>Breakdown of tasks</h2>

        <ul>
            <li>CAD design: The robot parts including the torso, head, arms, and feet (base) are all modeled in Rhino. I wanted to be more creative and less mechanical with this project and I felt Rhino was the best CAD program for this project. </li>
            <li>PGrasshopper: I wanted some of the parts of the Carry-it 2000 to look like tires or gears.  Tire tread/gear teeth is hard to model in Rhino, so I turned to Grasshopper to create the desired parametric pattern.  In Grasshopper I created repeating parametric pattern of tread/gear teeth on a circle, then extruded the shape and imported it into Rhino.</li>
            <li>d printing: Parts of the Carry-it 2000 will be printed on a Da Vinchi Mini W+ 3d printer. Files will be exported from Rhino as .stl files and imported into XYZ printing, which is the print print software for the Da Vinchi.</li>
            <li>Moving parts:  For the design I wanted the arms to move for novelty while providing the ability to hold various objects in different positions.</li>
            <li>Casting:   I intend to cast the base of the robot in plaster. I chose plaster because the added weight will reduce the chances of the robot tipping over. Also, the base will require a large amount of filament to produce, so for future replication of this part it made sense to use casting when creating multiple instances as opposed to repeated 3d printing. </li>
            <li>Finishing:  I intend spray paint the parts upon completion for better presentation, fit and finish. </li>
           

        </ul>

        <h2>Timeline with contingency plans</h2>

        <ul>
            <li>The following is contingent upon approval of my concept on Wednesday, 5/29</li>
            <li>5/31: Print the body of the Carry-it 2000 and mold for the base</li>
            <li>06/1: Create silicone mold for Base using Smooth-on.  Cast base into solidified Smooth-on mold</li>
            <li>06/2: Spray paint final parts, make final assembly.  Create 1st draft of web page assignment</li>
             <li>06/3: Proofread 1st draft of web page and make corrections</li>
             <li>06/5: Turn in final assignment web page</li>
        </ul>

   <h2>Bill of materials</h2>

        <ul>
            <li>Cast plaster:  $10.59 per per 2lb bag. For this project, my calculations reveal that I will only need 1 bag but have a backup as a contingency if re-casts are needed.  Both bags are in my possession as of 5/27</li>
            <li>PLA filament: $18.99 per spool.   My calculations reveal I will only need one spool but have a backup as a contingency. Both spools are in my possession as of 5/27</li>
            <li>Smooth-on silicone mold: $27.85 trial unit. My calculations reveal I the remaining Smooth-on trial unit I have will easily create my remaining mold.  Smooth-on is in trial unit is in my posession as of 5/27</li>
           
        </ul>
